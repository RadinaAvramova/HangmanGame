# Hangman Game
Welcome to the Hangman Game in C++! This project is a console-based implementation of the classic word guessing game, Hangman. It provides a fun and interactive way for players to test their vocabulary and guessing skills.

## Features
1. **Word Selection:** Selects a random word from a predefined list of words for the player to guess.

2. **Gameplay:** Allows players to guess letters to uncover the hidden word, with each incorrect guess resulting in the drawing of a hangman figure.

3. **Word Display:** Displays the current state of the guessed word, showing the correct letters that have been guessed and placeholders for the remaining letters.

4. **Win/Loss Conditions:** Determines win and loss conditions based on whether the player successfully guesses the word or runs out of guesses and completes the hangman figure.

5. **Interactive Interface:** Provides a user-friendly console interface for players to input their guesses and view the game status.

## Installation
To set up the Hangman Game in C++:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/Hangmangame.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd HangmanGame

3. **Compile the Program:** Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler such as g++:

g++ main.cpp -o hangmanGame

4. **Run the Program:** Execute the compiled binary to start playing the Hangman Game:

./hangmanGame

## Usage
1. **Start Game:** Start a new game of Hangman by running the program and following the on-screen instructions.

2. **Guess Letters:** Take turns guessing letters to uncover the hidden word. Each correct guess reveals the letter in the word, while incorrect guesses result in the drawing of a hangman figure.

3. **Word Completion:** Continue guessing letters until you either successfully guess the word or complete the hangman figure.

4. **Win/Loss:** The game ends in a win if you successfully guess the word before completing the hangman figure. It ends in a loss if you complete the hangman figure before guessing the word.

5. **Quit Game:** Exit the game at any time by selecting the option to quit.

## Customization
1. **Word List:** Customize the list of words used in the game to include words of different lengths and difficulty levels.

2. **Hangman Drawing:** Customize the hangman figure drawing to create your own unique artwork for each part of the hangman.

3. **Difficulty Levels:** Implement different difficulty levels with varying word lengths or limited guesses to provide players with a challenge.
